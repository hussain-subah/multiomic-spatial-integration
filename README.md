## Overview

This repository contains a modular multi-omic workflow for integrating annotated single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data with NanoString GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) Digital Spatial Profiling data.

The goal is to estimate cell-type-resolved spatial abundance in human brain tissue and test how inferred cellular composition varies by disease status, amyloid pathology, and vascular/parenchymal microenvironment.

The example biological use case focuses on AD/CAA versus control human brain tissue, with emphasis on vascular and parenchymal amyloid-associated remodeling.

---

## Workflow Summary

The workflow consists of ten major stages:

1. snRNA-seq preprocessing, QC, clustering, subclustering, and cell-type annotation  
2. GeoMx WTA processing, QC, and AnnData object construction  
3. Regression-based cell-type signature inference and Bayesian spatial deconvolution
   Note: training signatures separately for AD vs Control, however, If there is only a unified reference. this can also be made with this repo.
4. SVI spatial deconvolution
5. Extraction, normalization, and annotation of spatial cell-type abundances  
6. Statistical analysis of inferred cell-type proportions and spatial visualization
7. Biological validation
8. Pathway analysis
9. Method comparison
10. Figure generation

This structure follows the integrated workflow described in the internal project documentation.

# Note: Files under 'notebooks'
These files represent the modular, production-ready pipeline for spatial transcriptomics integration.
Although organized under notebooks/, they are implemented as .py scripts for:
   * reproducibility
   * version control stability
   * compatibility with HPC and batch execution

Each script:
   * uses utils
   * mirrors the logical steps of the analysis pipeline
   * can be run independently or as part of the full workflow

### Example notebooks:
This folder contains the original interactive notebooks and R Markdown files used during method development.

**Since V0.02 the Notebooks have had some bugs identified and fixed directly to the Notebooks and the example files are illustrative of the intital versions.**

These files:
* provide step-by-step exploratory workflows
* include intermediate checks and visualizations
* reflect the iterative development process
  
Recommended usage
* Use the .py scripts in notebooks → reproducible pipeline execution
* Use the Examples/ folder for:
      - understanding the workflow
      - exploratory analysis
      - adapting to new datasets

## Stage 1: snRNA-seq Reference Preparation
Annotated snRNA-seq data are used as the cellular reference for spatial deconvolution.
Main steps include:

- Ambient RNA correction when appropriate
- QC filtering
- doublet removal
- SCTransform normalization
- Harmony integration
- clustering and manual annotation
- targeted subclustering of astrocytes, microglia, and vascular cells
- Pearson correlation-based merging of highly similar subclusters


The reference includes major brain cell populations such as astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, OPCs, excitatory/inhibitory neurons, and vascular-associated populations. 

This repository uses the preprocessing logic developed in `neuro-snRNAseq-tools` to generate the annotated snRNA-seq reference. The original project-specific script included SoupX correction, QC, DoubletFinder, SCTransform, Harmony integration, manual annotation, targeted subclustering, Pearson-correlation-guided merging, and expression aggregation for spatial integration. 

### Dependency: neuro-snRNAseq-tools

This script depends on the `neuro-snRNAseq-tools` repository.

Clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/echimalj/neuro-snRNAseq-tools.git
```

## Stage 2: GeoMx WTA AnnData Construction
GeoMx WTA matrices are converted into a unified AnnData object.
The AnnData structure preserves:
- raw WTA gene counts
- negative probe counts
- ROI metadata
- disease status
- pathology status
- anatomical region
- scan/slide identifiers
- nuclei counts


Raw counts are stored in:

```Python
adata.layers["counts"]
```
Negative probe counts are stored in:
```Python
adata.obsm["negProbes"]
```
This structure ensures compatibility with downstream Bayesian spatial modeling. 


## Stage 3: Bayesian Spatial Deconvolution
The workflow uses a two-stage modeling strategy:

1.- Regression-based inference of cell-type signatures from snRNA-seq

2.- Bayesian spatial deconvolution of GeoMx WTA data using a SpaceJam / Cell2Location-style model implemented in Pyro


The spatial model incorporates:

- inferred snRNA-seq signatures
- GeoMx WTA counts
- negative probe background
- ROI nuclei counts
- scan/slide-level batch structure


The output is a cell-type abundance estimate per ROI. 

Model Adaptation
The spatial model was adapted from a PyMC3/Theano implementation into a Pyro/PyTorch framework to support:
- GPU acceleration
- stochastic variational inference
- WTA-scale gene panels
- explicit negative probe modeling
- nuclei-count-informed priors
- stable Negative Binomial likelihoods
- memory-safe saving of posterior outputs

These modifications preserve the conceptual SpaceJam structure while enabling scalable GeoMx WTA analysis. 


## Stage 4: Abundance Extraction and Annotation
After model training, posterior spatial factors are extracted and converted into:

- absolute abundance estimates
- relative abundance estimates
- ROI × cell-type long-format tables


These outputs are merged with GeoMx metadata and factor-to-cell-type annotation mappings for downstream visualization and statistical testing. 

## Stage 5: Statistical Modeling
Spatially inferred cell-type proportions are modeled using **beta mixed-effects models** in R.
The core model structure is:
``` R
rel_abundance ~ contrast_variable + (1 | Scan_ID)
```
using:
``` R
glmmTMB::beta_family(link = "logit")
```
This framework is appropriate because cell-type abundances are continuous proportions bounded between 0 and 1 and exhibit heteroscedasticity. A random intercept for Scan_ID accounts for repeated measurements at the ROI/sample level.

Multi-contrast framework

To disentangle disease and pathology effects, we implement four complementary contrasts:

### 1. Disease effect
 AD/CAA vs Control using amyloid-free ROIs only
→ isolates disease-driven changes independent of amyloid pathology

### 2. Amyloid effect (within AD)
 Amyloid vs AmyloidFree within AD/CAA
→ captures pathology-specific effects within diseased tissue

### 3. Max pathology effect
 AD/CAA Amyloid vs Control AmyloidFree
→ represents the strongest pathological contrast

### 4. Weighted overall AD effect 
 Pathology-weighted AD/CAA vs Control

This model accounts for heterogeneous amyloid burden across regions by defining:
```text
AD_overall = (1 − w) × AD_AmyloidFree + w × AD_Amyloid
```
where:
```text
w = proportion of amyloid-positive ROIs within AD/CAA (region-specific)
```
→ provides a biologically realistic estimate of the overall disease effect

### Effect size and inference
- Effect sizes are reported as log2 odds ratios
- Statistical contrasts are computed using emmeans
- Multiple testing correction is performed using Benjamini–Hochberg FDR, applied within region and contrast

### Design strengths

This modeling framework:
- Separates disease and pathology effects
- Accounts for spatial heterogeneity in amyloid burden
- Provides both controlled and extreme contrasts
- Enables biologically interpretable comparisons across microenvironments

For full details, see:
``` text
docs/statistical_modeling.md
```
## Stage 6: Validation framework
Multiple orthogonal validation strategies are implemented to evaluate inferred cell-type abundances.

Current validation includes:

• pseudobulk recovery

• independent marker-gene concordance

• regression-signature identity

• leave-one-scan robustness

• compositional analysis

• ROI nuclei normalization
   Because inferred abundances are compositional, the framework includes dedicated analyses to distinguish
      • true biological depletion
      from
      • apparent increases caused by compositional redistribution.

      ROI nuclei counts can also be incorporated to normalize inferred abundance on a per-cell basis.

These analyses distinguish technical failures from biologically expected subtype overlap and provide confidence in downstream interpretation.

## Stage 7: Pathway association analysis
Rather than performing enrichment on marker genes, the framework correlates inferred cell-type abundance with spatial gene expression, ranks genes by abundance association, and performs GSEA/fGSEA on those ranked lists.

This identifies biological pathways associated with changes in spatial abundance.

## Stage 8: Deconvolution benchmarking (WORK IN PROGRESS)
A modular benchmarking framework compares the Bayesian model against multiple deconvolution algorithms, including
   - SpatialDecon
   - MuSiC
   - Bisque
   - DWLS
   - BayesPrism   
   - SPOTlight
   - RCTD   
   - STdeconvolve

with standardized outputs for method agreement and reproducibility.

## Outputs
The pipeline generates outputs for each major analysis stage, including:

```text
Regression model
├── *_inferred_signatures.csv
├── *_mean_cluster_expr.csv

Bayesian deconvolution
├── *_spot_factors_abs.pt
├── *_spot_factors_rel.pt
├── *_celltype_abundance_long.csv

Validation
├── all_marker_validation/
├── marker_concordance/
├── pseudobulk_validation/

Statistical analysis
├── spatial_stats/
├── pathway_proportion_link/
```
Most downstream analyses use the standardized abundance tables in
`results/cell_proportions/`, allowing independent statistical workflows
to be reproduced without rerunning Bayesian deconvolution.

## Example Use Case

This framework was developed for spatial multi-omic integration of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) using
human postmortem brain tissue.

The workflow integrates:

- annotated single-nucleus RNA-seq reference atlases
- GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas spatial transcriptomics
- Bayesian cell-type deconvolution
- regression-derived cell-type signatures
- ROI-level statistical modeling
- marker-based biological validation
- pathway enrichment linked to spatial cell-type abundance

In the current application, this enables compartment-resolved analysis of
vascular, glial, and neuronal remodeling across parenchymal and vascular
amyloid microenvironments.

Although developed for AD/CAA, the framework is readily adaptable to any
study combining annotated sc/snRNA-seq references with GeoMx WTA or
related spatial transcriptomic platforms.

### Notes

- The repository is organized as a modular computational framework rather than a single-click pipeline.
- Each analysis stage can be executed independently using the corresponding scripts.
- Validation modules are designed to distinguish technical artifacts from biologically meaningful subtype overlap.
- Sensitive raw data and patient metadata should never be committed.
- Large trained model objects are best managed outside Git or through Git LFS.
- The modified Bayesian SpaceJam implementation is intended for research use and should be validated for new datasets.
